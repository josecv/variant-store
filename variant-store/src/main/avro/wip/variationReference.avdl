/* A sequence graph is made progressively joining new sequence pieces,
   which we call variants, into an existing graph.  This starts with a  
   primary sequence.  For example consider the primary sequence in
   GRCh38 for a chromosome.  Then variants can be joined into it,
   starting on a defined side of a defined base in the existing
   structure, containing new sequence (potentially empty if a pure
   deletion or breakpoint) and then joining back to another defined
   side of another base in the current graph.

   An arbitrarily complex reference graph is built this way, but we
   can also use the same construction to specify individual variants
   from the reference.

   Any base in the graph will have a unique identity defined by its
   variant id and 0-based position in the variant sequence.  It is
   oriented in the direction of the variant sequence.

   We support a context model for uniquely identifying bases in the
   graph.  Currently this is the UCSC left-right mapping proposal as proposed 
   by Paten, Haussler et al. - http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5010

/* Next we show how to provide information about samples.  The core
   idea is to provide Calls which each contain information about an
   Allele in a CallSet.  Loosely the alleles correspond to rows in a
   VCF and the callsets to a column, but there are some key differences.

   First, we provide information separately about alleles not sites
   (unary variant model).  We can determine from the graph whether two
   alleles are incompatible in the same haplotype and hence "allelic"
   in the standard usage of the term.  Note that this is a pairwise
   relation, not transitive, so we don't support sites as sets of
   alleles in the way that VCF does.  This avoids the problems when
   merging sites in VCF.  Our merge semantics are simple: only merge
   identical alleles.  Identity can be checked by name when sharing a
   global name and definition space, or recursively by how the alleles 
   are constructed from global objects when scope is local.

   Second, we represent phase information by separate haplotype
   callSets, rather than using some sort of | or / or | notation or
   equivalent in the calls of a genotype callSet.  So genotype
   callSets just contain allele counts (copy number) or dosages.  This
   is the only way to provide phase data. Because we support sparse
   callSets, which we hope can be lightweight, each piece of partial
   phasing (as for example supported by phase sets in VCF) will be a
   separate haplotype CallSet on the same sample.

/* Finally, note that while typically an Allele is short, this
   structure also allows us to define a long allele as a literal
   sequence path through the graph incorporating (parts of) multiple
   variants.

   For example, it supports defining alleles to represent ALT haplotypes
   from GRCh38 or an LRG (clinical locus-specific reference sequence) 
   that differs from the canonical reference.

   Other people may want to define variants on these "Allele"
   sequences.  It would be possible to write code to map those onto
   the reference graph.  This could support mapping variants between
   coordinate systems.  There has been interesting discussion about
   this in the context of dbSNP and representation of variation on 
   multiple references.
